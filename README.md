## What

Our project is to make a game where you control a swarm running down a hallway. You must jump over obstacles and survive as long as possible.

## Installation

All we require is Lua and [Love](http://love2d.org). If you are on Ubuntu, you can install love with the following:

 1. `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bartbes/love-stable`
 2. `sudo apt-get update`
 3. `sudo apt-get install love`

Then, `make` and you can play our game!
